## 🎯 WHAT YOU HAVE:

Your platform is now a **closed POS system** for merchants and customers:

### **Merchant POS Terminal** - `/merchant/pos`
- Build transactions with items and prices
- Start transaction for customer
- Monitor transaction status in real-time
- Cancel transactions
- Reset for next customer

### **Customer Terminal** - `/customer/terminal`
- See transaction details from merchant
- Scan fingerprint to verify identity
- Choose payment method (Credit, Debit, Bank Account)
- Complete payment
- Auto-reset for next customer

---

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS:

### Merchant Side:
1. **Add Items** - Enter amounts and add to transaction
2. **View Total** - See subtotal, tax, and final total
3. **Start Transaction** - Sends amount to customer terminal
4. **Wait for Customer** - Watch real-time status
5. **Payment Processes** - Monitor as customer pays
6. **Auto-Reset** - Ready for next customer

### Customer Side:
1. **See Transaction** - Amount and items appear automatically
2. **Scan Fingerprint** - Touch fingerprint scanner
3. **Choose Payment** - Select from saved methods
4. **Complete** - Payment processes
5. **Auto-Reset** - Ready for next transaction

## 💡 HOW TO TEST:

### Option 1: Two Browser Windows
1. Open **http://localhost:3000/merchant/pos** in one window
2. Open **http://localhost:3000/customer/terminal** in another window
3. Position windows side-by-side
4. On merchant POS: Add items → Start Transaction
5. On customer terminal: Watch transaction appear → Scan fingerprint → Pay
6. Both auto-reset for next customer

### Option 2: Two Browser Tabs
1. Open two tabs in same browser
2. Load merchant POS in one, customer terminal in other
3. Switch between tabs to simulate real terminals
